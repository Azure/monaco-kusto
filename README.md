# Monaco Kusto

Kusto language plugin for the Monaco Editor. It provides the following features when editing CSL, KQL files:

-   Code completion
-   Syntax highlighting
-   Validation: Syntax errors and linting
-   code folding / outlining
-   Hovers
-   Find definition
-   find all references
-   rename symbol

## Usage

`npm install @kusto/monaco-kusto` or `yarn add @kusto/monaco-kusto`

### Package content

-   `/esm` Contains esm version of the library
-   `/dev` Contains an AMD version of the library
-   `/min` Contains a minified AMD version of the library

### AMD module system:

Example at [/samples/amd](https://github.com/Azure/monaco-kusto/tree/master/samples/amd)

1. Run `npm run copyMonacoFilesAMD <path>` or `yarn copyMonacoFilesAMD <path>`
   where <path> is where you want the monaco and kusto amd modules to be. These
   files will need to be served as-in.
2. Using a amd module loader, import `vs/language/kusto/monaco.contribution` 1. The monaco editors included loader can be made available via a global
   require `require` by adding the script tag: `<script src="<path>/vs/loader.js"></script>`
3. You should now be able to create monaco editors with `language: 'kusto'`. The
   kusto worker can be reached via the monaco global:
   `monaco.languages.kusto.getKustoWorker()`
4. If using typeScript, add "@kusto/monaco-kusto/globalApi" to compilerOptions.types in tsconfig.json`

### ESM

Parcel example at [/samples/parcel](https://github.com/Azure/monaco-kusto/tree/master/samples/parcel)

1. Configure your bundler so `@kusto/monaco-kusto/release/esm/kusto.worker` has it's own entry point
2. Configure the global `MonacoEnvironment` with either `getWorkerUrl` or `getWorker`
3. You should now be able to create monaco editors with `language: 'kusto'`. The
   kusto worker can be reached via the monaco global:
   `monaco.languages.kusto.getKustoWorker()`

### Setting a schema

There are 2 APIs to set a Kusto schema:

1. `setSchema` - the passed schema is of type `ClusterType` (defined in `schema.ts`).
   The database in ROOT.database will be the one in context.
2. `setSchemaFromShowSchema` - a method to set a schema from the result of the
   Kusto query `.show schema as json`. The result is a list of databases (see
   interface `Result` in `schema.ts`), so when this method is used, it also
   requires a cluster URI and the name of the database in context.

## Contributing

### Setting up a dev environment

1. Install Node.js 20 https://nodejs.org/
2. Run `corepack enable` to make the `yarn` package manager available (https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
3. Clone repo and run `yarn` in repo root
4. Run `yarn watch` from /package and a http-server will automatically open the index.html

### Build for release

1. Set CI environment variable to "tru"
2. Run `yarn build`
